## LibDriver MAX6675

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/max6675/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The MAX6675 performs cold-junction compensation and digitizes the signal from a type-K thermocouple. The data is output in a 12-bit resolution, SPI-compatible, read-only format.This converter resolves temperatures to 0.25°C, allows readings as high as +1024°C, and exhibits thermocouple accuracy of 8 LSBs for temperatures ranging from 0°C to +700°C.The MAX6675 is available in a small, 8-pin SO package.It can be used in industrial, appliances, HVAC and so on.

LibDriver MAX6675 is a full-featured driver of MAX6675 launched by LibDriver.It provides reading temperature function and so on. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver MAX6675 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver MAX6675 SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver MAX6675 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver MAX6675 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver MAX6675 offline document.

/datasheet includes MAX6675 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_max6675_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
uint32_t times;

times = 3;
res = max6675_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    uint16_t raw;
    float temp;

    /* read data */
    res = max6675_basic_read(&raw, &temp);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)max6675_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    max6675_interface_debug_print("%d/%d %0.2fC.\n", i + 1, times, temp);

    /* delay 1000ms */
    max6675_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)max6675_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
